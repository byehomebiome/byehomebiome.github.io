            <p>As a student, I regularly use the internet. I research for my assignments, or just casually surfing the web. Without realizing, I have already searched in one sitting, over 30 times. Imagine, with Ecosia, that's almost one tree planted. You see, when you use Ecosia, a tree is planted for roughly every 45 searches you make. Ecosia automatically tracks how many searches you have made so all you have to do is search away. As you do your regular routines on the internet, you are also helping our Earth. I have been using Ecosia for over a month now, and so far, I have searched over 200 times already. That's more than 4 trees planted already! While I'm minding my own business surfing the web, I am helping out the Earth at the same time. Through Ecosia, anyone who has access to the net can help out in little ways. But wait, there's more! Not only does every search help plant a tree, but it also helps reduce CO2 emissions. Their servers run on 100% renewable energy, and every search request removes 1kg of CO2 from the atmosphere. Don't worry about privacy issues. Ecosia promises that they anonymize all searches within one week. They also don't sell your data to third party trackers. Overall, through my month of using Ecosia, nothing has changed in how I search or what results I get. The only thing that is different is that I am helping out the Earth with every search I make. You can help out too! Just visit their website <a href="https://www.ecosia.org/?c=en">here.</a></p>
